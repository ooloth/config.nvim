# My Neovim Config

I rebooted my config by starting with kickstart.nvim and evolving from there.

Moving this config to its own repo was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.mitchellhanberg.com/create-your-own-neovim-distribution/) by Mitchell Hanberg.

This is all highly personalized and experimental, so be sure to fork and adjust for your own needs before using!
